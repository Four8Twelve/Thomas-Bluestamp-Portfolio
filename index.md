# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the modules I added to my mirror. I mounted a PIR sensor to the mirror to detect movement and turn on, dual displays, and software addons to the MagicMirror2. I had issues with the PIR sensor, which did not work at all. Some only displayed high, and some didn't dispaly anything. I found that the sensors I bought were faulty, and only 1 out of 8 sensors worked. The dual displays also would not display two different MagicMirror2 screens, which I think was a problem with the electron redirecting it to the first one. So i decided to adapt my project, displaying the MagicMirror2 on one screen, and a usable raspberry pi on another screen. This setup will let me run other projects on the mirror, such as an octopi for my 3d printer. I now make sure to test everything and double check everything, as this would have saved my so much time.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was finishing the basic magic mirror. This was done by mounting my display to the mirror and mirror frame, then locking the mirror in with 3D printed brackets. I had issues with the adhesives to mount the mirror, as nothing would stick to the acrylic. I then had the idea to print custom brackets to keep the mirror in place, using a pressure fit design instead of having to glue the mirror and risk ruinning the project. I now make sure to always look for more obscure ways to solve a problem, instead of jumping in on what is the most obvious or straight forward idea.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up my raspberry pi and uploading the software for the smart mirror. This was done by engraving a micro sd card for the raspberry pi, then downloading the software called MagicMirror2. I had issues with the raspberry pi software but it was solved by formating the micro sd card, which then let the raspberry pi recognize the micro sd. The MagicMirror2 software had some bugs, but quick searches told me that the file were named incorrectly. I now make sure to double check everything before going in for the finished product, as this saves my a lot of time.
