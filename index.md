# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up my raspberry pi and uploading the software for the smart mirror. This was done by engraving a micro sd card for the raspberry pi, then downloading the software called MagicMirror2. I had issues with the raspberry pi software but it was solved by formating the micro sd card, which then let the raspberry pi recognize the micro sd. The MagicMirror2 software had some bugs, but quick searches told me that the file were named incorrectly. I now make sure to double check everything before going in for the finished product, as this saves my a lot of time.
